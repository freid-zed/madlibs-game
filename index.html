Talk Like a Pirate

Ye can always pretend to be a bloodthirsty <span class="noun"></span>, threatening 
everyone by waving yer <span class="adjective"></span> sword in the air, but until ye learn 
to <span class="verb"></span> like a pirate, ye'll never be <span class="adverb"></span> accepted 
as an authentic <span class="noun"></span>. So here's what ye do: Cleverly work into 
yer daily conversations <span class="adjective"></span> pirate phrases such as "Ahoy there, 
<span class="plural-noun"></span>," "Avast, ye <span class="plural-noun"></span>," and "Shiver me 
<span class="plural-noun"></span>." Remember to drop all yer <i>gs</i> when ye say such words as 
<i>sailin', spittin',</i> and <i>fightin'</i>. This will give ye a/an <span class="body-part"></span> start to 
being recognized as a swashbucklin' <span class="noun"></span>. Once ye have the lingo 
down pat, it helps to wear a three-cornered <span class="noun"></span> on yer head, 
stash a/an <span class="noun"></span> in yer pants, and keep a/an <span class="noun"></span> 
perched atop yer <span class="body-part"></span>. Aye, now ye be a real pirate!
